## What Is Encode Escape

This quick and easy tool handles every day encoding conversions for developers so you spend more time programming.


## Why Encode Escape

This app was written primarily as a proof of concept to see if a Rust / Tauri app could be uploaded to the Apple and Windows app stores. The answer after a lot of pain is yes to the Apple app store. The Windows store is TBD.

This was also written to test if a reasonably professional app could be created easily enough in Tauri. The answer to that is a resounding yes.

But why this app? It wasn't obvious at the time that there was a simple app that handled encoding / decoding tasks for developers. There are others out there but this tool has its place. The unicode operations in particular are very enlightening.

## Tech Stack

Rust + Tauri + Svelte + Typescript

The app is primarily written in Rust with a web UI handled by Tauri. The front end only handles user interactions and is written in Typescript / Svelte. All data processing is handled in rust.
