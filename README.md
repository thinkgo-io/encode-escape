## What Is Encode Escape

This quick and easy tool handles every day conversions for developers so you spend more time programming.


## Why Encode Escape

This app was written primarily as a proof of concept to see if a Rust / Tauri app could be uploaded to the Apple and Windows app stores. The answer after a lot of pain is yes to the Apple app store. The Windows store is TBD.

Also, it wasn't obvious at the time that there was a simple app that handled encoding / decoding tasks for developers. There are quite a few out there but this has its place.

Rust + Tauri + Svelte + Typescript

The app is primarily written in Rust with a web UI handled by Tauri. The front end only handles user interactions and is written in Typescript / Svelte. All data processing is handled in rust.
